#### **Description**  
This is the second and final part of your independent analysis project. Building on the dataset and analysis plan developed in Part 1, you will conduct a comprehensive analysis. This includes data wrangling, handling missing data, and applying at least two different machine learning methods to your dataset. Your goal is to draw meaningful conclusions and evaluate the performance of the applied methods, showcasing your ability to synthesize course concepts.

#### **Assignment Objectives**  
By completing this assignment, you will:  
1. Develop a comprehensive workflow for data analysis, from preparation to model evaluation.  
2. Demonstrate proficiency in handling missing data and ensuring data quality.  
3. Apply multiple machine learning methods and compare their performance.  
4. Communicate your analysis and findings effectively through code, visuals, and a written report.

#### **Assignment Tasks**  

1. **Data Wrangling and Preprocessing**  
   - Load your dataset from Part 1.  
   - Perform any additional cleaning and preprocessing steps identified as needed in Part 1.  
   - Document transformations and justify their relevance to your analysis goals.  

2. **Handling Missing Data**  
   - Identify any remaining missing data issues in your dataset.  
   - Apply appropriate techniques to handle missing data, and explain the rationale behind your choices.  

3. **Machine Learning Analysis**  
   - Select at least two machine learning methods relevant to your dataset and research questions.  
   - Implement these methods and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.  
   - Evaluate the models using suitable metrics.  

4. **Model Comparison**  
   - Compare the performance of the at least two methods using quantitative metrics and visualizations.  
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of your dataset and analysis goals.  

5. **Results and Interpretation**  
   - Summarize your findings, highlighting key insights and implications of the analysis.  
   - Reflect on the overall effectiveness of the applied methods and any limitations of your approach.  

6. **Documentation and GitHub Integration**  
   - Update your GitHub repository from Part 1 with all code, data, and documentation for this assignment.  
   - Ensure the repository is well-organized and includes clear instructions for reproducing your analysis.

#### **Deliverables**  

Submit a structured report in .Rmd format and upload to your personal Github page in a new repo. I will be running your .Rmd file so please make sure your submission is executable and replicable. Remember to document your process thoroughly as with descriptions in the text of the .Rmd file. 

1. **Analysis Report**  
   - A structured report that includes:  
     - A summary of data wrangling and missing data handling.  
     - Description and rationale for the machine learning methods applied.  
     - Evaluation results and model comparisons.  
     - Discussion of findings and limitations.  

2. **Code and Repository**  
   - Submit all scripts or notebooks used for the analysis.  
   - Provide a link to your updated GitHub repository, ensuring it is well-documented and organized.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Include at least three visualizations to support your analysis.
