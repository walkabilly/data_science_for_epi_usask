**Value:** 10% of Final Grade  

#### **Description**  
This assignment focuses on foundational data wrangling techniques and the ability to effectively clean, analyze, and visualize data. You will work with real-world datasets to practice essential skills in data preparation, exploration, and integration. Your goal is to transform raw datasets into a format ready for analysis, draw meaningful insights using descriptive statistics, and present findings visually.

---

#### **Assignment Objectives**  
By completing this assignment, you will:  
1. Develop skills in cleaning and preprocessing raw data, including handling inconsistent data.  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics.  
3. Integrate multiple datasets by performing joins and ensuring consistency in the merged data.  
4. Create meaningful visualizations to summarize and communicate your findings.

#### **Assignment Tasks**  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Load the provided datasets and examine their structure (e.g., columns, data types, unique values).  
   - Identify and correct issues such as outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Calculate key statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) for relevant variables.  
   - Identify trends or anomalies based on these statistics.  

3. **Joining Datasets**  
   - Combine two or more related datasets by performing appropriate join operations (e.g., inner join, left join).  
   - Ensure the resulting dataset maintains consistency and completeness.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Create at least three visualizations to highlight key findings.  
   - Use appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps) and ensure clarity in labels, legends, and formatting.
